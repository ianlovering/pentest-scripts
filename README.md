# pentest-scripts
Collection of simple scripts useful for Pen Testing

## scan-tcp.py
Runs TCP nmap scan then creates various Nessus scans based on the results.

## scan-all.sh
For a list of ip addresses runs a UDP nmap scan and the scan-tcp.py script above.
Each instance runs in a separate tmux window in the background, allowing interaction and control if required.
Limits the number of parallel scans to 30 (can be changed).

## nessus_run_scans.py
Monitors a Nessus scanner and launches all scans in a given folder. Once complete moves the scans into folders based on policy name. Separates scans that failed to authenticate when required into another folder.
Completed scans are automatically exported as nessus files.

## nessus_aggregate.py
Combines multiple .nessus files into one based on scan names.
